# Andrew Burbage Senior Project: Silent 911

This prject consists of an application that allows the user to make a text to 911 call. While the technology exists at some departments this app will allow for all to have access irregardless of their local emergency services provider's capabilities. The application will prompt the user with a series of questions much like those a dispatcher would ask. From those responses it forms a script that is then read by text to speech over a loop to a phone call to the local dispatch allowing them to get the vital information needed to deploy responders.

Actively migrating to Kotlin 2.0 + Compose – check back 02-24-26 for the full update!
